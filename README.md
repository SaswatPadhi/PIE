**PIE now lives in the [LoopInvGen repo](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/LoopInvGen)
as an OCaml module within the LoopInvGen system.
We provide an [example application](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/LoopInvGen/tree/master/app)
that demonstrates how to use this module.<br>
The module is significantly faster than the original PIE and is easier to use.**

This repository is only for archival purposes.
We make the original benchmarks used for evaluating (the original) PIE,
so others can use them for their own experiments.
